> This weekâ€™s question:
>Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the sub-sequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
>
>Example:
>'''
>$ longestSubSeq([1, 9, 87, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2, 45])
>$ 4 // 1, 3, 4, 2
>
>$ longestSubSeq([36, 41, 56, 35, 91, 33, 34, 92, 43, 37, 42])
>$ 5 // 36, 35, 33, 34, 37
>'''

Did this one as unit tests because last week was my final week at my job and then there were kid birthday parties and invasion news to obsess over and I basically missed the deadline - starting on the solution around the same time the next newsletter was going out. So this was a thrown-together solution - about 30 minutes of time spent - and just done as a unit test rather than a console app this time.
