> Implement a word search. Given a 2D array of letters and a word to find, return the 2D array with the found word’s letters replaced with an asterisk (*). If you can’t find a word, just return the 2D array or “not found”.
> 
> Example:
> ```
> let grid = [['a','a','q','t'],
>             ['x','c','w','e'],
>             ['r','l','e','p']]
> 
> $ findWord(grid, 'ace')
> $ [['*','a','q','t'],
>    ['x','*','w','e'],
>    ['r','l','*','p']]
> ```
